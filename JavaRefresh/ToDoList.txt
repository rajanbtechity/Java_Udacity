int fun(int n) 
{     
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) 
    { 
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j += i) 
        { 
            // Some O(1) task

2. Permutation Problem

Recursion Exercise
Write a permutation of [1, 2, 3] (permutation gives several possible variations, in which a set or number of things can be ordered or arranged).

Give an array with unique integers, print all permutations.

Example

Input: [1, 2], print 12, 21

Input: [1, 2, 3], print 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321.
